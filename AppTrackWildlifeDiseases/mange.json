    "projectDescription": "COVID-19 and many other emerging diseases, such as Ebola and the avian flu, have origins in wildlife. Thus, it is crucial to monitor wildlife diseases. However, this is expensive and time-consuming, and the diseases could emerge in areas without monitoring. Citizen science brings an opportunity for the early detection of wildlife diseases. This project will focus on the development of an app, freely available to the public, to track mange, an infectious disease in wildlife that is easy to detect by non-experts. Mange is spreading globally and Virginia has an ongoing epidemic of bears. Thus, this disease is a great model to implement the app, which can be expanded to other diseases in the future.",

    "mangeDescriptionOffLine": "Mange is a type of skin disease caused by parasitic mites.Because mites also infect plants, birds, and reptiles, the term \"mange\" or colloquially \"the mange\", suggesting poor condition of the hairy coat due to the infection, is sometimes reserved only for pathological mite-infestation of nonhuman mammals. Thus, mange includes mite-associated skin disease in domestic animals (cats and dogs), in livestock (such as sheep scab), and in wild animals (for example, coyotes, cougars, and bears). Since mites belong to the arachnid subclass Acari (also called Acarina), another term for mite infestation is acariasis.Parasitic mites that cause mange in mammals embed themselves in either skin or hair follicles in the animal, depending upon their genus. Sarcoptes spp. burrow into skin, while Demodex spp. live in follicles."
